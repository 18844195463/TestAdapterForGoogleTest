* enhancement: the location of the pdb file is now also looked up within the according test executable, providing source locations and traits even in cases were the pdb's name is different from the name of the test executable, or where the pdb ends up outside of the executable's path ([#45](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/pull/45), thanks to [Stefan Winkler](https://github.com/nafest) for the pull request)
* enhancement: options are now grouped into categories ([#44](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/44))
* enhancement: release notes are shown after the extension has been updated ([#48](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/48))
* bugfix: if [Dia crashed](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/1908082/dia140-fails-in-various-ways-when-using-debug-fastlink), the pdb under analysis remained locked, and the tests contained in the according test executable were not found (part of [#46](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/46), thanks to [Jesse Olmer](https://github.com/JesseOlmer) for report and example solution)

Note that the options to assign traits by means of regexes have been renamed, resulting in lost settings of these options inside VS. Solution and user file settings are not affected. Make sure you backup your existing settings before updating; in case VS has updated the extension before you had the chance to backup your settings, you can look them up by using the regedit tool: the adapter's settings are located at `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\[12.0|14.0]\DialogPage\GoogleTestAdapter.VsPackage.OptionsPages.GeneralOptionsDialogPage`.
