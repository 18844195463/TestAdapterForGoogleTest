* enhancement: custom C++ macros for adding traits to tests are now variadic, allowing for up to TODO traits to be assigned to each test, and greatly reducing code duplication ([#38](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/38))
* enhancement: minor speed improvements during test execution; note that test adapter execution time while running tests is still dominated by registration of the test results with Visual Studio, see [#15](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/15) (part of [#52](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/52))
* bugfix: Release notes didn't work properly ([#53](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/53))
