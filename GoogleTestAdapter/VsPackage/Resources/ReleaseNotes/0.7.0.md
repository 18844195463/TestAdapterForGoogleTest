* enhancement: custom C++ macros for adding traits to tests are now variadic, allowing for up to 16 traits to be assigned to each test, and greatly reducing code duplication ([#38](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/38))
* enhancement: minor speed improvements during test execution; note that test adapter execution time while running tests is still dominated by registration of the test results with Visual Studio, see [#15](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/15) (part of [#52](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/52))
* bugfix: Release notes didn't work properly ([#53](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/53))
* VS regression fixed: with update 2, the [handling of test adapter options had been broken](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/2744287) (Community and Professional edition). The [release candidate of update 3](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2015-update3-vs) fixes that problem ([#50](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/50))
* VS regression fixed: with update 2, [registering test results with VS became very slow for large numbers of tests](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/2748800) (all editions). The [release candidate of update 3](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs2015-update3-vs) fixes that problem ([#52](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/52))
