* bugfix: we are working on removing the difference between running and debugging tests (e.g., test crash detection is not working, and test output can not be printed to test console in debug mode). Additionally, the new test execution environment reports test results to VS during test execution, giving a slightly faster and more responsive user experience. It can be used by setting the *Use new test exexution environment* option to *true* and should now also work fine when debugging in X64 mode. Feel free to give it a try; if you encounter any problems, please report them to us ([#76](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/76))
* bugfix: reference to LICENSE.txt has been fixed in NuGet specification ([#96](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/96), thanks to [JackGrinningCat](https://github.com/JackGrinningCat) for report and fix)
