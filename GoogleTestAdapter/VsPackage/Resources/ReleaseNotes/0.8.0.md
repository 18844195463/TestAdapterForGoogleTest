* enhancement: We are now using the same code to run and debug tests. This has two major benefits: there is no difference between running and debugging tests now (e.g., test crash detection is now working in debug mode, and test output can be printed to the test console), and test results are now reported to VS during test execution, giving a slightly faster and more responsive user experience. Note that the old test execution environment is still in place, but the new one is used by default; if you encounter any problems, please *report them to us* (since we are going to remove support for the old execution framework soon) and then use the *Use new test exexution environment* option to go back to the old execution framework ([#76](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/76))
* bugfix: GTA can now deal with special characters (e.g., German umlauts) in test names, test suite names and prefixes, and value parameters ([#72](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/72))
