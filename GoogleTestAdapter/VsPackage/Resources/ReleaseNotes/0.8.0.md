* enhancement: there is no difference between running and debugging tests any more, e.g., test crash detection is now working, and test output can be printed to the test console in debug mode. Additionally, test results are now reported to VS during test execution, giving a slightly faster and more responsive user experience. Note that the old test execution environment is still in place, but the new one is used by default; if you encounter any problems, please *report them to us* (since we are going to remove support for the old execution framework soon) and then use the *Use new test exexution environment* option to go back to the old execution framework ([#76](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/76))
* enhancement: the restriction that tests can be run on at most as much threads as there are available processors has been removed ([#80](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/80))
* enhancement: when tests are executed in parallel, some simple statistics about expected and actual test durations (which influence test distribution) are printed in debug mode ([#81](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/81))
* bugfix: GTA can now deal with special characters (e.g., German umlauts) in test names, test suite names and prefixes, and value parameters ([#72](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/72))
* bugfix: standard output parser could not deal with tests where one test's qualified name would be a prefix of another test's qualified name ([#82](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/82))
* maintainability: refactored test project structure, added references to projects of SampleTests solution to main solution ([#82](https://github.com/csoltenborn/GoogleTestAdapter/issues/82))
