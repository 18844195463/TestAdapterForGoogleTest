Before release:
	code review
	end-to-end tests
	reduce # of known issues if possible :-)

Release:
	Clone repository on GitHub
	Set up GitHub page, Wiki, Issues tracker
	Publish on MS market

For next releases:
	parse param value from test name, print into TestResult
	move settings into XML file to be saved into solution dir
	performance optimizations
		scheduling
		parallel test discovery
		improve canceling time by actively killing test processes
		lock duration files on file base
	smarter scheduling, e.g.
		reduce number of times executables are invoked
		define (configurable?) minimum duration for threads
		introduce option to assign test ressources to threads
			scheduling would then make sure tests are not running at same time when competing for test resources
	refactoring
		TestDurationSerializer
			XML format
			date, time?
		refactor Helpers
		factor out placeholder values in container class to be passed around?
	more placeholders for batches and execution params
		project?
		name of executable?
	more test coverage
	CI build

Known Issues
	"error message if run automatically after build" bug
	"not all test results are shown" bug
		debug branch has option to change waiting time through UI
	exceptions after debugging
