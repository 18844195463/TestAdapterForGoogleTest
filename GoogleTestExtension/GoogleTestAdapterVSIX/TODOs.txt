	end-to-end tests
	change target VS version to >= VS2015
	docs
	fix test stability of test ParallelGoogleTestExecutorTests.RunsHardCrashingX86TestsWithoutResult
		fails occasionally, probably because of distribution of tests to invocations of executable
	fix "not all test results are shown" bug
		goal: remove waiting in TestResultsReporter
	fix "error message if run automatically after build" bug
		goal: should work :-)

For next release:
